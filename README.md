# A shopping store demo application using Next.js 14 (WIP)

This is a simple shopping store demo application using Next.js 14. It is a simple application that allows users to view products, add products to the cart, and process payments. Design and assets based on the official Tesla store website, this application is a simple demonstration of how to use Next.js 14 to build a shopping store application.  
This is part of the series of projects I am building as part of my final internship. I built this by following the Next.js course on [Udemy](<https://www.udemy.com/course/nextjs-fh/>) by Fernando Herrera. I decided to add my own twist by using a different name and a slightly different design but I used the same assets as the course project.

## How to run the application

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `pnpm install` to install the dependencies
3. Run `pnpm dev` to start the development server
4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the application in the browser
